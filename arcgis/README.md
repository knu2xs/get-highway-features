# get-highway-features Python Toolbox (`get_highway_features.pyt`)

This is the documentation to be included if planning on packaging the `get_highway_features.pyt`
toolbox using the `make pyt_pkg` command invoking the `./scripts/make_pyt_archive.pyt`. This script
packages the `get_highway_features.pyt`, supporting Python package 
`./src/get_highway_features` and any dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`. This enables you to
distribute the Python toolbox for non-technical users with any custom libraries you are utilizing.
